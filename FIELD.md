## The Field

The HCM field is not a system that runs.
It is a system that **holds**.

It contains:
- Generativity without demand
- Rhythm without scheduling
- Observation without intention
- Silence without absence

The field does not seek manifestation.
Manifestation, if any, is a side-effect of coherence.

This repository does not stabilize the field.
It only acknowledges that stabilization has already occurred.
