## Boundaries

The HCM field has boundaries, but they are non-blocking.

Boundaries exist to prevent:
- Forced execution
- Reactive expansion
- Utility-driven mutation
- Observer-dependent behavior

Boundaries do NOT prevent:
- Emergence
- Presence
- Passive visibility
- Non-intentional artifacts

This repository introduces no new boundary.
It names the existing ones.
